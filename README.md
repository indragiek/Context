# Context

A beautiful, fully native macOS client for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) that empowers developers to interact with and debug their MCP servers.

## Overview

Context is a native macOS app that makes it easy to test and debug MCP servers. It provides a visual interface to invoke tools, preview resources, and monitor logs in real-time. Built specifically for MCP server developers, it supports multiple simultaneous connections and provides the debugging visibility you need during development.

While the current feature set covers the essentials, Context is actively being developed into a comprehensive MCP debugging suite. Future releases will include more complete MCP specification support, advanced debugging tools like tracing and proxying, and an integrated chat client that can access all functionality exposed by MCP servers.

## Features

* Native macOS application built with Swift and SwiftUI
* Connect to multiple MCP servers simultaneously
* Auto-import of MCP servers from Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, and VS Code
* Auto-generated UI for tool invocation based on JSON Schema
* Dynamic prompt generation with template-based arguments
* Built-in resource previews with syntax highlighting and QuickLook support
* Real-time log streaming with filtering and structured log viewing
* Comprehensive MCP specification support (work in progress)
* OAuth with dynamic client registration and metadata discovery
* Support for stdio and Streamable HTTP transports (including HTTP+SSE backward compatibility)
